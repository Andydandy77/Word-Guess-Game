# Hangman: Summer of Love Edition

## Overview
In this project, I set out to create a hang man style game with some of my favorite bands from the 1960's pscyhedelic rock scene. When the page loads, the website will alert the user that it is a new game, and then it will randomly pick a band from a set of bands I have chosen. The user guesses which letters the band name contains, and if they guess correctly, the dashed lines incrementally reveal themselves. The user gets fifteen guesses for each band, and the game does not let the user guess a letter he has already guessed. 

If the user guesses the band name within fifteen guesses, he wins and the win count is incremented. Whether the user wins or not, the band name is revealed and an associated image appears on the right. If the user wins, the band name is removed from the list. If the user loses, he gets another chance to guess correctly!

Once the user guesses all bands, he has won the game!
